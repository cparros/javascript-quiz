# javascript-quiz
This is one assignment in which we are tasked to create a javascript quiz that covers some basic knowledge as well as Local Storage and adding sounds to buttons. 

I had a great time with this assignment however the one thing that has given me some trouble is appending to  lists in local storage. I enjoyed praciting working with the DOM and learning some of how local storage works, I just cannot seem to figure it out completely. 

I will continue to work on the Highscore List in hopes I can fix this issue!
